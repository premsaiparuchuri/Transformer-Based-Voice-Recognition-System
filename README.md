# Transformer-Based-Voice-Recognition-System
Voice recognition technology has transformed our interactions with digital devices,
enabling features like virtual assistants, transcription, and security systems. Traditionally, voice
recognition relied on hand-engineered features and classical machine learning, which struggled
with variations in audio quality and speaker characteristics. Transformer-based models, such as
Wav2Vec2, now offer advanced solutions by capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data
and learning directly from raw audio. This system utilizes Wav2Vec2 for audio feature extraction
and a custom transformer-based classifier to identify singers in audio recordings. Data
augmentation techniques enhance the modelâ€™s robustness across diverse audio conditions. The
system achieved high accuracy, highlighting its potential applications in music streaming,
copyright management, and audio content organization. This work demonstrates the transformative
capabilities of transformers in audio processing and points toward future advancements in voicebased technologies.
